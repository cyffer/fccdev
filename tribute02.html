						Bhﾄ《kara's work on calculus predates Newton and Leibniz by over half a millennium. He was perhaps the first to conceive the differential coefficient and differential <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhﾄ《kara_II#CITEREFGoonatilake1999" target="_blank">calculus</a>.
					</li>
					He is particularly known in the discovery of the principles of differential calculus and its application to astronomical problems and computations.
					<li>
						While Newton and Leibniz have been credited with differential and integral calculus, there is strong evidence to suggest that Bhﾄ《kara was a pioneer in some of the principles of differential calculus.
					</li>
					<li>
						As a prominent mathematician of his time his main work is contain in Siddhanta Shiromani.
					</li>
					<li>A proof of Pythagorean theorem by calculating the same area in two different ways and then canceling out terms to get a2 +b2=c2.
					</li>
					<li>
						Solution of quadratic, cumin and quartic indeterminate equations are explained
					</li>
					<li>
						Solutions of indeterminate quadratic equations ( of the type ax2+b = y2)
					</li>
					<li>
						Integer solution of linear and quadratic indeterminate equations.
					</li>
					<li>
						Solved quadratic equation with more than one unknown, and found negative and irrational solutions.
					</li>
					<li>
						In Siddhanta Shiromani, Bhaskara developed spherical trigonometry along with a number of other trigonometric results.

					With more than 600 manuscripts of the work reported so far and more than 30 extant commentaries attest that it was the most popular mathematica textbook in india used by number of people on the entire subcontinent. it was translated into india language of the north and south but also persian several times in the sixteenth and seventeenth ventures and into English in the nineteenth century and Japanese in the 20th century
